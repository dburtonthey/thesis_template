\chapter{Experiments} \label{ch:chapter2}

This is a very short guide to an unofficial thesis/dissertation template for the University of Tennessee. It is based on the 2010 thesis specifications but can be easily altered as the guidelines are changed. This template requires a basic knowledge of \LaTeX\ and should cover the basic requirements in terms of required packages and functionality.
