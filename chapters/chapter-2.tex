This is a citation~\cite{utk:idr2016optimization}.
This is a very short guide to an unofficial thesis/dissertation template
for the University of Tennessee\footnote{UTK is a public university in Knoxville,
TN}.
It is based on the 2017\footnote{The 2017 template was based on a 2016 template} thesis specifications but can be easily altered
as the guidelines are changed.
This template requires a basic knowledge of \LaTeX\ and should cover
the basic requirements in terms of required packages and functionality.
