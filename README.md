# Thesis/dissertation template in LaTeX for UTK

1. **utk-class.cls** contains the formatting based on UTK guidelines.
    You should not need to change this file.
1. **utk-main.tex** is the main file that gets compiled.
   It invokes all the other files (chapters, appendix, bib) in the correct order.
1. **utk-refs.bib** is a bibliography sample file
1. **utk-main.pdf** is the PDF produced with the default configurations
1. **utk-guide-to-thesesdissertations.pdf** is the official UTK guide to
   theses/dissertations
1. **figures/**, **front-matter/**, **chapters/**, **back-matter/**
   are directories that should be self-explanatory once you take a quick look
   at them and the PDF generated (utk-main.pdf)
