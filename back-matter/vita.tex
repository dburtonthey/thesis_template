\addToTOC{Vita}
\chapter*{Vita} \label{vita}

The vita should be written in narrative form, not resume or curriculum vitae form.
It should contain appropriate academic and professional information about the
author/student.

Because copies of the manuscript will be available to the public,
personal information, such as the student's address or phone number, should not
be included.
